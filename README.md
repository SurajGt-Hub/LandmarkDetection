# LandmarkDetection

This project focuses on **Landmark Detection using Deep Learning**.  
It identifies and classifies landmarks from images using an EfficientNet-based convolutional neural network trained on real-world datasets.


## Overview

The goal of this project is to build an intelligent system that can automatically detect and recognize famous landmarks from images.  
This kind of system can be applied to:
- Tourism and travel apps
- Geographic image tagging
- Visual search engines
- Smart city solutions


## Technologies Used

- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- EfficientNetB0  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  


# Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   Images are resized, augmented, and normalized for model input.

2. **Model Training:**  
   EfficientNetB0 is used with transfer learning and callbacks like EarlyStopping and ReduceLROnPlateau.

3. **Evaluation:**  
   The model is evaluated on validation and test sets to measure classification accuracy.

4. **Prediction:**  
   The trained model predicts landmarks from new unseen images.
